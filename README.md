# Arduino
This is the basic intro to Arduino UNO R3 theory and practice. Here are the resources for self-learning
Initially I had a folder inside my cpp repo. Today I just decided to make a new one for Arduino
inside are the links to simulator, to video courses

The repo has folders for every project and files with url links to introductory educational videos, a book with projects.
Inside the project folders there are folders of a project which has a slightly different version.
Every project version has the code in cpp and the picture of wiring the boards.
