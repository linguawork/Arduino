    The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip, 
    with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability, 
    produced by Espressif Systems in Shanghai, China. 
    ESP8266. ESP8266-IC. Manufacturer. Espressif Systems.

    The NodeMCU V2 is a development kit based on the ESP8266 for programming of 
    Wireless LAN controlled projects with open source firmware. 
    With only a few Lua-script lines, 
    it is possible to create your own IoT project with this module you can connect 
    to a SBC for instance.

    OPERATING VOLTAGE
    3.0 - 3.6 V (operable via 5V-microUSB cable)

2 How to upload a web site to ESP8266 Web server 
        https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-web-server-spiffs-nodemcu/
            his tutorial shows how to build a web server that serves HTML and CSS 
            files stored on the ESP8266 NodeMCU filesystem (SPIFFS) using Arduino IDE. 
            Instead of having to write the HTML and CSS text into the Arduino sketch, 
            weâ€™ll create separate HTML and CSS files.
